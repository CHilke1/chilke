#Problem #1
#Users are the worst- they are always forgetting how to use the software properly. 
#Write a program that barks at the user every time they enter in the same input twice. 
#You must use a while loop to continually ask the user for input, and you must use a for loop to 
#iterate through the list of user inputs.
