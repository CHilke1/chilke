				    <h3>The Nineteenth Century</h3>
                   
                      <p>The Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio at 951 Chicago Avenue in Oak Park, Illinois, has been restored by the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust to its appearance in 1909, the last year Frank Lloyd Wright lived there with his family.[3] Frank Lloyd Wright purchased the property and built the home in 1889 with a $5,000 loan from his employer Louis Sullivan.[3] He was 22 at the time, and newly wed to Catherine Tobin. The Wrights raised six children in the home.[3] The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and declared a National Historic Landmark four years later.</p>
                      
				   
                   <h3>The Twentieth Century</h3>
				   
				      <p>The Gehry Residence is located in Santa Monica, California. In 1977, Frank and Berta Gehry bought a pink bungalow that was originally built in 1920.[citation needed] Gehry wanted to explore with the materials he was already using â€” metal, plywood, chain link fencing, and wood framing. In 1978, he chose to wrap the outside of the house with a new exterior while still leaving the old exterior visible.[2] He hardly touched the rear and south facades and to the other sides of the house he wedged in tilted glass cubes. Then, in the fall of 1991, he chose to remodel due to the needs of a growing family that by then included two teenage boys.[citation needed] Many of Gehry's neighbors were not happy at the unusual building being built in their neighborhood.</p>
